# Introduction

Servers have been an integral part of a computing architecture for decades, but the technology and approach have evolved and with the introduction of the cloud, organizations started moving to web-based server infrastructure has led us to a serverless architecture.

It is often the case that organizations and their technology ecosystems as they grow face challenges managing and scaling architectures.

As a result, the time and efforts that should be invested in the work that makes the most difference â€” ideation, innovation are gobbled up by managing and maintaining the server infrastructure.

Serverless architecture has evolved to encompass other aspects of applications as well as enabling customers to develop, run, and manage application functionalities without having to build and maintain the infrastructure.

The development of serverless applications requires serverless computing, as well as serverless storage and function-to-function networking.

Using such serverless architectures, smaller teams and developers can develop their products without investing much into scalability or server maintenance, which means:

- No server management is necessary
- Serverless architectures are inherently scalable
- Quick deployments and updates are possible
- Code can run closer to the end-user, decreasing latency and more.
