# Why Serverless

 - Variable in price. Vendors charge you only for what you use. 
 - Self-maintaining. Clients don't need to perform server maintenance. 
 - Scalable. They scale up and down continuously with no client programming help. 
 - Reliable. These products have built-in high availability and fault tolerance.


Advantages of serverless computing over server app include:

 - Cost. You'll only pay for what you use. In some other cloud-based models, you'll reserve space (whether you use it or not).

 - Flexibility. Serverless models scale without your intervention. 

 - Accuracy. Developers can focus on a specific function rather than worrying about the back-end architecture that supports that action. This separation of powers could allow for cleaner code. 

 - Speed. Developers don't need to waste time worrying about estimating and allocating server space. 

# When to use Serverless.

 - For who wants to implement light-weighted applications which can scale relatively easily. 
 - Who don't want to spend much money on managing servers. in which serverless is much efficient and fast.
 - Most of the part is for scalability only.
