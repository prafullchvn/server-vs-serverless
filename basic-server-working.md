# Basic server working

Client would be requesting server. Server would be in a container and has application in it, along with it's dependencies. This model is called as `Request and Response model`.

When client makes a request to server, few actions would take place. First server would be identifying the message sender, where message sender should be authenticated to access the data. The second task is by the server responding in a response way to the request. This is how a basic server would be working.

# Types of server architectures

- Client server architecture
- Peer to peer architecture

## Client server architecture

Client/server architecture is a computing model in which multiple components work in strictly defined roles to communicate. The server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client. This type of shared resources architecture has one or more client computers connected to a central server over a network or internet connection.

Client/server architecture is also known as a networking computing model or client/server network because all the requests and services are delivered over a network. Itâ€™s considered a form of distributed computing system because the components are doing their work independently of one another.

## Peer to peer architecture

Peer-to-peer architecture (P2P architecture) is a commonly used computer networking architecture in which each workstation, or node, has the same capabilities and responsibilities. It is often compared and contrasted to the classic client/server architecture, in which some computers are dedicated to serving others.

P2P may also be used to refer to a single software program designed so that each instance of the program may act as both client and server, with the same responsibilities and status.

P2P networks have many applications, but the most common is for content distribution. This includes software publication and distribution, content delivery networks, streaming media and peercasting for multicasting streams, which facilitates on-demand content delivery. Other applications involve science, networking, search and communication networks.
