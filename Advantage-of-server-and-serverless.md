# Advantages of serverless

## Why to use serverless computing ?

Serverless computing offers a number of advantages over traditional cloud-based or server-centric infrastructure. For many developers, serverless architectures offer

- greater scalability
- more flexibility, and
- quicker time to release, all at a reduced cost.

With serverless architectures, developers do not need to worry about

- purchasing
- provisioning, and
- managing backend servers.

However, serverless computing is not a magic bullet for all web application developers.


## Advantages of serverless computing:

- No server management is necessary
- Developers are only charged for the server space they use, reducing cost
- Serverless architectures are inherently scalable
- Quick deployments and updates are possible
- Code can run closer to the end user, decreasing latency
