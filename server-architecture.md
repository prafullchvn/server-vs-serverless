## Overview of general Server architecture

# Introduction

Server architecture is the foundational layout or model of a server, based on which a server is created and/or deployed. It defines how a server is designed, different components the server is created from, and the services that it provides.

Server architecture primarily helps in designing and evaluating the server and its associated operations as well as services in whole before it is actually deployed. Server architecture includes, but is not limited to:

- Physical capacity of server (computing power and storage)
- Installed components
- Types and layers of applications and operating system
- Authentication and overall security mechanism
- Networking and other communication interface with other applications and/or services

So basically we can say that, a server's architecture can be defined by:

- How it communicates with other devices
- The types of operating systems it uses
- Hardware and software components
- Storage and computing capabilities
- The security functions within its systems
