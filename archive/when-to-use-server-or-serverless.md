# When to use serverless.

  One of the biggest benefits of serverless computing is its scalability. If youâ€™re expecting growth and require an environment that will meet the demand and adapt to your needs, serverless is the right path.

  - Building applications with serverless functions requires a different approach than traditional server hosting, and the decision to use serverless depends on the problem it solves and the time investment required.

  - Serverless is advantageous for scaling to large amounts of traffic at a low cost, but learning the nuances and setting up a local development environment can be time-consuming.

  - While the serverless framework provides tools and documentation for managing resources and deployment, the development of functions lacks a standardized framework. Serverless is still evolving, and if you're comfortable with setting up a development environment and using a preferred language, it may be worth waiting for further maturity.

  - If you plan to use a new JavaScript framework for the frontend and host API endpoints with serverless, it can be relatively straightforward to figure out. However, if you anticipate more complex backend requirements, be prepared for a significant time investment.

  - Consider going the serverless route when decreasing go-to-market time is a critical factor. Serverless architectures are ideal for building lightweight, flexible applications that can be quickly expanded, upscaled, or updated.

  - Serverless is well-suited for projects with fluctuating usage and high computing power requirements in short bursts. Applications like data integration pipelines or machine learning model training can benefit from cost reductions by going serverless.

  - Serverless is a natural fit for stateless processes such as email senders or push notification agents. These processes involve short-running logic, have high-performance requirements, and don't rely on persistent state or direct access to a filesystem.

#### Tip : 
  Utilizing [MidyJS](https://middy.js.org), a middleware npm package that helps abstract configuration and promotes code reuse between functions.


# When to use server.

  Server computing is a valid option for companies that cannot entirely rely on a stable internet connection. Businesses with a well-skilled IT department ready to maintain servers, upgrade hardware, and solve issues themselves can also benefit from the on-premise server architecture.

  - Full Access. Managed and maintained within the company by the in-house IT team, on-premise servers allow unlimited access. In other words, your IT department can install or alter any software, quickly fix issues, and have absolute control over backups.

  - Security. As all of your critical data is safely stored on the premises and no third-party service has access to it, the server computing model is known for high security. When debating server versus serverless, many people bring up this issue, and for a good reason. Data protection is an important part of IT activities, as breaches and hacker attacks are becoming more frequent and severe.

  - No dependency on internet connection. On-premise servers allow IT staff to access valuable data at any time, even when the internet connection is poor or unstable. Even in 2021, there are a lot of regions with disruptive internet service where people cannot safely rely on a stable connection at all times.
