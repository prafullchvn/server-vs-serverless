# When to use Serverless

## 1. You want to reduce server costs.

Going serverless will significantly reduce server costs. That's because cloud providers only charge for the time that serverless functions are running so you're not paying for unused resources.

## 2. You want to free up developer resources.

Since no one has to deal with infrastructure management when going serverless, developers and engineers can focus solely on building out new features and improving the product.

## 3. You want to scale your web application.

Switching to serverless can help your web application scale with no operational concerns.
